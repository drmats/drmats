## Hi there 👋

_“If you say making money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living. That is, to go on doing things you don’t like doing. Which is stupid. Better to have a short life, which is full of what you like doing, than a long one spent in a miserable way.”_ - [Alan Watts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LRQCWABfI00)
